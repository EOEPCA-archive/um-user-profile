= Building Block Design

[NOTE]
.Content Description
================================
This section contains:

* A concise breakdown of the Building Block in several independent services (when applicable). For each component, the following subsections are added:
** Overview and purpose: indicating the functionality covered by the component
** SW Reuse and Dependencies: indicating reuse of third party open source solutions (if any) and any pre-required Dependencies
** Interfaces: both internal to the building block and those exposed externally
** Data: Data usage of the building block, data flow and any GDPR concerns should be addressed here
** Applicable Resources: links and references to (Reference Docs), and repositories.

When a breakdown is necessary, a general overview of the building block can be given. On the contrary, no breakdown indicates a single component development with the same expected sections.

== Web Service
=== Overview and Purpose
The web service is the user interface for all other components on this module.

This same web service holds an interface for user attributes' edition and profile removal for a user.

=== Software Reuse and Dependencies

All requirements for the executing of the web service are found under src/requirements.txt, and expect Python 3.6.9 or greater to work.

The most important are:

* **EOEPCA-SCIM**: Used to auto-register itself as a client to the Auth. Server upon startup
* **WellKnownHandler**: Used to dynamically check the configuration of the Authorization Server on each execution. For example, it can get the needed endpoints for any API the Web Service needs, like the SCIM endpoints.
* **Flask**: External to EOEPCA's project, this library allows the Web Service to handle HTTP requests, to act as a web server.

=== Interfaces TODO

=== Data
==== Configuration

The Web service gets all its configuration from the file located under `src/config/WEB_config.json`.

The parameters that are accepted, and their meaning, are as follows:

- **sso_url**: hostname or IP of the Auth Server.
- **title**: Title that will be seen when navigating to the web interface
- **scopes**: Scopes used for the internal OAUTH client. Currently, the required are: "openid", "email" and "user_name"
- **client_id**: Client ID used for the internal OAUTH client.
- **client_secret**: Client secret for the corresponding client_id.
- **redirect_uri**: Redirect URI configured in the client, which should point to this service's callback URL.
- **post_logout_redirect_uri**: Redirect URI for post logout of a user.
- **base_uri**: Base URI for all requests against the web server
- **oauth_callback_path**: Callback path for the end of a succesful oauth flow.
- **logout_endpoint**: Endpoint for the logout of a currently logged in user.
- **service_host**: Host to listen on (localhost, 0.0.0.0, etc..)
- **service_port**: Port to listen on for the web server
- **protected_attributes**: Attributes that the user can see about their profiles, but not edit
- **blacklist_attributes**: Attributes that the user can not see or edit.
- **separator_ui_attributes**: Separator used for multi-level attributes
- **color_web_background**: Color used for the background of the web, in HEX.
- **color_web_header**: Color used for the header of the web, in HEX.
- **logo_alt_name**: Alternative name for logo of the web
- **logo_image_path**: Path to logo of the web
- **color_header_table**: Color used for the header of any table
- **color_text_header_table**: Color used for the content of any table
- **color_button_modify**: Color used for the modify button
- **use_threads**: Toggle threads for requests. Enabling this in production is recommended
- **debug_mode**: Toggle debug mode, which enables a debug web interface, more errors and logs.

== SMTP Client
=== Overview and Purpose

The SMTP Client incorporated with this module serves as a basic mean of sending emails to the user. Currently, the only email configured to be sent is the registration confirmation, but this can be expanded in the future.

=== Software Reuse and Dependencies 

* **smtplib + email**: Basic python libraries which provide a communication layer to an SMTP server

=== Interfaces TODO
=== Data
==== Configuration
The following configuration is extracted from ENV variables upon start:

- **EMAIL_ADRESS**: Email used to send the email
- **EMAIL_PASSWORD**: Password for the respective email address.

The following are constants hardcoded in code, but easily changable, and will be variables in the future:

- **host**: SMTP server to comunicate to. Default is 'smtp.gmail.com'
- **port**: SMTP port to connect to. Default is '465'

Additionally, the client will work with the system's trusted CA certificates, in order to provide certification validation and all other SSL-related capabilites.
